## Reporting bugs
You can open up an issue on the GitHub (although I don't check it very much) or you may message me on v3rmillion / Discord.

If you are reporting any issues, please include the following information:

* What song are you playing?
* What executor are you using?
* What side are you playing on (right, left)?
* (optional) A video showcase of you using it and it not working (upload to streamable or youtube)
* (optional) A screenshot of any errors in F9 console or Synapse X internal console.
