## Overview and Purpose
This script allows you to fully convert an osu!mania chart into a Lua script that is compatible with Funky Friday's engine.<br>
The osu!mania chart **must be 4-key**. Anything higher or lower will not work.<br><br>
When I used to be into VSRGs very religiously, this was my go-to game to play on ROBLOX. There was a point where I got tired of the same songs, so I noted this project down as a concept. A few months later, I was tinkering with wally-rblx's autoplayer. I suddenly realized that [you can edit the notes when they load](https://youtu.be/FscazwnUDjk). So I set out to make this abombination that you see in front of you.<br><br>
You can use this script to play songs for fun or practice, as Funky Friday's engine is very lenient when it comes to notes.<br><br>
Just remember, this is all **client-sided and singleplayer**, meaning no one will be able to hear or see you play songs in-game.<br><br>

## Files and where to download
This repository contains a few files, most importantly **the converter** and **the in-game GUI**.<br><br>
The converter made written in Python and converts .osu files into readable Lua.<br>
The GUI was written in Lua for executors, and you can load and configure the songs that you want.<br><br>
### If you are experienced with Python, you can download the source code (it is open-source :D)<br>
